Chatbot Idea: Campus Info Assistant

Problem Addressed:
Many students struggle to quickly find information about campus services, lecture schedules, and general university updates. This chatbot can help answer common questions, guide students, and provide links or instructions for further actions.

Key Features:

Answer questions about lecture schedules, campus hours, or locations.

Provide contact information for departments (IT, library, administration).

Give reminders about upcoming events or deadlines.

Handle simple small-talk or greetings.

Use Spacy NLP to understand intent from natural language input.

Limitations:

Cannot understand queries outside predefined intents.

Misinterprets complex or ambiguous questions.

May fail to respond if a student uses slang or very casual language outside of its training examples.
